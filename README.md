# Project-Euler-Problems

The purpose of this repo is to keep a log of Project Euler Problems I have completed on my own in preparation for technical interviews in my job search as a Junior Software Developer.

It is so important to me to maintain and improve the skills I have learned from my Boot Camp experience. This career path is all about learning and improving and by solving these problems, it allows me to continue to grow.
